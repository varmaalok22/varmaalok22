- 👋 Hi, I’m Aalok Varma, a graduate student at NCBS, Bangalore. I study how the cerebellum functions, using the larval zebrafish as the model.
- 👀 I am a self-taught programmer and am interested in working at the interface of life sciences and computer science, especially by developing tools and/or applying methods from computer science like machine learning to solve biological problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about machine learning and about how to use Github consistently for my projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects to improve scientific communication.
- 📫 How to reach me: Shoot me an email at varmaalok22[at]gmail.com, if you'd like to reach me.
